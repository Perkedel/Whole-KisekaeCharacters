##**WARNING! THIS GIT IS RADIOACTIVE! USE WITH PRECAUTION!**
The file you are about to see may contains nuts, milk, grain, etc. If you are allergentic with such of those things please refrain from using this git. Enforcing so may cause brain damage which is 25x much worse than a car accident and other shock concussion incidents.
Also if you have history of abusal of these allergens, DO NOT abuse this git too!!! This git also eats your brain like a zombie if you don't careful.
If you are uncertain about these warnings, please ask our waiters around. They will ready to serve you

##What's this?
This is the git that talks about easy listing for usability, known as __library__. This is a git that helps you find your favourite character for use in Kisekae and other Open source 3D or 4D or 5D or whatever `D` CGI thingy that supports it or you made to support it whatever way you do. We have counting list of characters starting by DeviantArt to the far far away beyond proxy (really__?__).

YEs, you dude, that using Kisekae. And you make something about it. COmics, striplines, posters, etc. that make people fans of it, even somekind of experiments.

There will be updates to the app. so stay tuned! and be creative.

##How to use
You simply open up the other file than this. Just go to the ../ENTER DOOR/BEGIN/LISTS.md

Once you are in there, find your favourite characters by looking one and scroll down until you got it. yeah!

Once you found it use that code bellow the character image to import it to your application. Now the story is up to you.

##I don't see my character
Don't worry if you don't see one. simply issue it here and we will find one until we got it. It might takes some time, because we do need to find the source, ask the source and permission, etc. etc. Then we need to build the character picture, fill in and give a nice metadata, tidy it up and done!
But you can initiatively fork, edit, pull request it which is Duper Awesome. We will merge it if your change is apropriate.

##About license file in this folder
The license file here only applies to my original characters and others who wanted to licensed it same as mine or similar concept about. It also license this list as.
Even though the license will be told every single character so we will able to know well the treatment procedure if necessary.
